<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Wild Rye Baking is a bakery with a deep love for what pairs perfectly with a good drink. 
  Rooted in slow craft and bold flavor, we bake rustic breads and pastries designed to be enjoyed 
  alongside coffee, wine, beer, and spirits. From hearty rye loaves to savory bites with just the right 
  balance of salt and texture, everything we make is meant for lingering—at the café table, the bar, or 
  the kitchen counter. Inspired by the wild character of rye and the social ritual of sharing food and 
  drink, Wild Rye Baking creates bakes that invite you to sip, snack, and stay awhile.</p>
